Running the program normal vs parallel really made a big difference. When running a file with alot of links they is a significant difference in time for example i used craiglist and bestbuy to demestrate this. 
When running the main page of best buy, and using the built in time in the command line. It took 3 min and 37 seconds when running normal. 
When running the same url with parallel it brought the time down to only 19 seconds.

The second trial was craisglist which also has alot of links.
When running in normal mode i got 28 seconds. 
When runnign in parallel i got only 4 seconds. 

And when i ran these in cslab there was a significant difference as well since more threads are able to run.
